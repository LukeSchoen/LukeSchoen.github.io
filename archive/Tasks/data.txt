// Items //
// dragging ground to ground, cant separate items!
// Weapons 10x or so in price, but 10x harder to drop!
// Don't follow with ranged items (looks like insanity)
// dragging ground hams on top of hams doest mix (so random)
// saying fuck you to the guard should make them attack you (but just once?)
// when cap is full glitches on floor when you purchase items from shops.

// Mobs //
// neutral mob interaction
// Completely wipe all drops, items are completely fucked, coming up with new drops will be awesome!

// Mobs With ranged attacks don't use Melee attacks (should use both)
// remove crusader helmet from "Bandit" mob
// Hunters should not drop knight armor only plate knight maybe RARE ASF
// Behavior //
// Monsters should consistently face their target, even if it's unreachable.
// Mobs don't attack when first in range - kiting where only player hits
// All mobs should have a level next to their name (tried it, its ok)
// Mobs should only follow so long without you attacking them then they should disengage
// There should be mobs that don't attack you unless you attack them etc (you can trade with them etc)

//
// Loot //

// way more interesting mob Loots!
